        introduction: "This project demonstrates the implementation of an advanced security automation solution that integrates SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation and Response) with EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) technologies. The growing complexity and volume of cyber threats demand faster, more coordinated responsesâ€”making automation essential for modern security operations.\n\nThe architecture leverages Tines as the SOAR platform to orchestrate intelligent workflows and LimaCharlie as the EDR solution for real-time endpoint monitoring. The system automatically detects threats, orchestrates investigations across multiple channels, and executes coordinated response actions. This integration dramatically reduces response time, eliminates manual errors, and improves overall SOC operational efficiency.",
